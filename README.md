===

## Submission Instructions
  * Work in a fork of this repository
  * Work in a branch on your fork
  * Write all of your code in a directory named `lab-` + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab-duncan`
  * Submit a pull request to this repository
  * Submit a link to your pull request on canvas
  * Submit a question, observation, and how long you spent on canvas  

## Learning Objectives  
* Students will understand the purpose of a server side router
* Students will be able to implement a rest API using using nodes http module

## Resources  
* [Nodejs http docs]

## Requirements  
#### Configuration  
<!-- list of files, configurations, tools, ect that are required -->
Your lab directory must include  
* **README.md** -- with a documention about your lab
* **.gitignore** -- with a robust gitignore
* **.eslintrc** -- with the class .eslintrc file
* **.eslintignore** -- with the class .eslintignore
* **.package.json** -- with all dependencies and dev-dependencies
* **lib/** - a directory for helper modules
* **model/** - a directory for constructor functions
* **test/** - a directory for test modules
* **server.js** - entry point to your program

#### Feature Tasks  
<!-- a list or description of the feature tasks you want the students to implement -->
* Create a HTTP Server using the http module
* Create a Object Constructor that creates a _resource_ with at least 3 properties
 * An `id` property that is set to a unique **node-uuid** id is required
 * Also include two other properties of your choice (cant be same sas class lecture reource)
* Create a body parser that uses Promises to parse the json in the body of `POST` and `PUT` requests
* Create a Router Constructor that manages requests to `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests
* Create a route for doing `CREATE`, `READ`, and `DELETE` operations on your _resource_
* Create a storage module that will store resources by their _resource_ type and id

**dont name your endpoint `/api/resources` name it after your model**  

###### `POST` `/api/<resources>`
* pass data as stringifed json in the body of a post request to create a resource
* if their was no _resource_ with that id it should respond with a 404

###### `GET` `/api/<resources>`
* if their was no _resource_ with that id it should respond with a 404
* pass an `?id=<uuid>` in the query string to retrieve a specific resource as json

###### `DELETE` `/api/<resources>`
* pass an `?id=<uuid>` in the query string to delete a specific resource
* on success it should return 204 status with no content in the body
* if their was no _resource_ with that id it should respond with a 404

## Testing  
* write a test to ensure that your api returns a status code of 404 for routes that have not been registered
* write tests to ensure your `/api/resource-name` endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
 * `GET` - test 404, responds with 'not found' for valid request made with an id that was not found
 * `GET` - test 400, responds with 'bad request' if no id was provided in the request
 * `GET` - test 200, response body like `{<data>}` for a request made with a valid id
 * `POST` - test 400, responds with 'bad request' for if no `body provided` or `invalid body`
 * `POST` - test 200, response body like  `{<data>}` for a post request with a valid body

##  Documentation  
<!-- a description of what you want the student to write about in their readme -->
* Write a description of your project in your readme
* Write api documetnion for your routes in your readme

## Bonus
* **2pts** a `GET` request to `/api/simple-resource-name` with no **?id=** should retrun an array of all of the ids for that resource
 * if you do this bonus you dont have to the **400** get request test

## Rubric  
* 2ps Configuration
* 3pts Feature Tasks
* 3pts Tests
* 2pts Documentation
